    "gap_analysis": "The paper acknowledges the importance and potential of population coding for semantic information and complex stimuli, but it does not directly investigate or provide a detailed understanding of how population coding works. It primarily focuses on single-unit and multi-unit activity, suggesting that population-level encoding of semantic categories is conceivable but not directly studied."

    ],
    "priority": "MEDIUM",
    "gap_analysis": "While the paper provides strong evidence for feature extraction by ventral stream neurons (e.g., face neurons responding to visual features), it doesn't detail the *proven mechanism* of how these features are extracted at a cellular or circuit level, beyond selective firing. The 'early processing' aspect is covered for visual features, but the mechanism itself could be more deeply elaborated."
